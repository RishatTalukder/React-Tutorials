# REACT 18 (PART-1 : Basics, Rules, Syntax, and Some FUN PROJECTS)

This is my `6th` attempt at learning react Fully. And nothing else to say about that. Let's do this!

This whole article series is inspired by `john Smilga` or the `coding addicts` udemi course. I loved the way he teaches and I learned a lot from his `youtube` channel. As a programmer and programming content creator, I thought making a series of articles on `React` will help me to learn it better and also help others to learn it.

I also have a youtube channel where I make `Python` tutorials in `Bangla`. Soon I'll start a video series on `React` in `Bangla`. So, this is like a praparation for that.

## What is React?

I think you all know what `REACT` is but let's just forget that. `React` is a front-end library developed by `Facebook`. It's a library not a framework. That's it!

## Installation

First you need `Node` js installed in your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After installation check the version of `Node` and `NPM` by running the following commands in your terminal.

```bash

node -v

npm -v

```

If a version number is shown then you are good to go. Now, create a new folder with any name you want and navigate to that folder in your terminal.

Now, run the following command to create a new react app.


```bash

npx create-react-app first-app

```

This will create a react app named `my-app`, in your folder with all the necessary files and folders needed for a react app. But before going deep into the `my-app` folder, we need to make some changes. 

As `REACT 19` is out and with it's all new issues and bugs, I'll be using `REACT 18` for this series. So, we need to install `REACT 18` in our app. To do that, navigate to the `my-app` folder in your terminal and run the following command.

```bash

npm install react@18 react-dom@18

```

This will install `REACT 18` in your app. Now, you are ready to go. To start the app, run the following command.

```bash

npm start

```

This will start the app in your default browser. You can also open the app in your browser by going to `http://localhost:3000/`.
