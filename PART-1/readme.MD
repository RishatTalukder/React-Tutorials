# REACT 18 (PART-1 : Basics, Rules, Syntax, and Some FUN PROJECTS)

This is my `6th` attempt at learning react Fully. And nothing else to say about that. Let's do this!

This whole article series is inspired by `john Smilga` or the `coding addicts` udemi course. I loved the way he teaches and I learned a lot from his `youtube` channel. As a programmer and programming content creator, I thought making a series of articles on `React` will help me to learn it better and also help others to learn it.

I also have a youtube channel where I make `Python` tutorials in `Bangla`. Soon I'll start a video series on `React` in `Bangla`. So, this is like a praparation for that.
